In order to use Web3Auth, you'll need to create a project in the [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and get your client ID.

- Go to [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/), create or select an Web3Auth project:

- Add `{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}://auth` to **Whitelist URLs**.

- Copy the `Client ID` and paste it inside `res/values/strings.xml` file.

- It will be used as `R.string.web3auth_project_id` during initialization.
