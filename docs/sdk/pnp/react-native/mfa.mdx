The Multi-Factor Authentication feature refers to the ability of the user to create a backup share (recovery phrase). This helps them log into a new
device and also to recover their account if they lose their original device.

:::note

This is a paid feature and the the minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this SDK in a production environment is the
**Growth Plan**. You can use this feature in the development environment for free.

:::

You can set the `mfaLevel` within the `web3auth.login()` to customize when the mfa screen should be shown to the user. It currently accepts 4 values:

- **`default`** - Setting the mfaLevel to default will present the MFA screen to the user on every third login. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.DEFAULT`
- **`optional`** - Setting mfaLevel to optional will present the MFA screen to the user on every login but the user will have the option to skip it.
  `mfaLevel = MFALevel.OPTIONAL`
- **`mandatory`** - Setting mfaLevel to mandatory will make it mandatory for the user to set up MFA after login. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.MANDATORY`
- **`none`** - Setting mfaLevel to none will skip the mfa setup screen totally. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.NONE`

```tsx
export const MFA_LEVELS = {
  DEFAULT: "default",
  OPTIONAL: "optional",
  MANDATORY: "mandatory",
  NONE: "none",
};
```

## Using the `mfaSettings` to configure the MFA Order

You can configure the order of MFA or enable/disable MFA type by passing the `mfaSettings` object in `OpenLoginOptions`. We offer the following backup
factors under `mfaSettings`:

- `deviceShareFactor`,
- `backUpShareFactor`,
- `socialBackupFactor`, and
- `passwordFactor`.

```tsx
export declare const MFA_FACTOR: {
  readonly DEVICE: "deviceShareFactor";
  readonly BACKUP_SHARE: "backUpShareFactor";
  readonly SOCIAL_BACKUP: "socialBackupFactor";
  readonly PASSWORD: "passwordFactor";
};
export type MFA_FACTOR_TYPE = (typeof MFA_FACTOR)[keyof typeof MFA_FACTOR];
export type MFA_SETTINGS = {
  enable: boolean;
  priority?: number;
  mandatory?: boolean;
};
export type MfaSettings = Partial<Record<MFA_FACTOR_TYPE, MFA_SETTINGS>>;
```

## Example

```tsx
const state = await web3auth.login({
  loginProvider: LoginProvider.GOOGLE,
  redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
  // highlight-next-line
  mfaLevel: MFALevel.MANDATORY, // MFALevel.DEFAULT, MFALevel.OPTIONAL, MFALevel.MANDATORY, MFALevel.NONE
  mfaSettings: {
    deviceShareFactor: {
      enable: true,
      priority: 1,
      mandatory: true,
    },
    backUpShareFactor: {
      enable: true,
      priority: 2,
      mandatory: true,
    },
    socialBackupFactor: {
      enable: true,
      priority: 3,
      mandatory: true,
    },
    passwordFactor: {
      enable: true,
      priority: 4,
      mandatory: true,
    },
  },
});
```
