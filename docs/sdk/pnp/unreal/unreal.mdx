The Web3Auth [Unreal Engine SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-unreal-sdk) is a client-side library that allows you to authenticate users using
Web3Auth on `Unreal` game engine. This SDK has been written mainly in `C++` and can be integrated preferably across all mobile platforms. It returns a
private key generated in a non-custodial way on successful user authentication. This authentication can be achieved by using any social login options
that Web3Auth supports or using a custom authentication flow of your choice.
