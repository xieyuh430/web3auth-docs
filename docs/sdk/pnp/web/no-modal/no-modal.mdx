Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal is the main SDK that consists of the core module of Web3Auth Plug and Play. This SDK gives you all the needed modules
for implementing the Web3Auth features, giving you the flexibility of implementing your own UI to use all the functionalities. Since this package
doesn't contain the UI Modal as compared to [`@web3auth/modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/modal) package, the size of this package is smaller.

#### This Documentation is based on the `7.1.0` SDK Version.
