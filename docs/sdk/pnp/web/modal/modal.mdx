This package provides the main class for using the default Web3Auth Modal. The package includes all of our packages and gives you a simple way of
implementing Web3Auth within your interface. Additionally, it is a child class of [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) package. Hence, you
can still call all the functions available in the [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) package.

#### This Documentation is based on the `7.1.0` SDK Version.
